Description: The 'funOmics' package ggregates or summarizes omics data into 
            higher level functional representations such as GO terms gene sets 
            or KEGG metabolic pathways. The aggregated data matrix represents
            functional activity scores that facilitate the analysis of 
            functional molecular sets while allowing to reduce dimensionality 
            and provide easier and faster biological interpretations. 
            Coordinated functional activity scores can be as informative as 
            single molecules!
